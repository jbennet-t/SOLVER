# SOLVER
The goal of this project is to get students registered to vote, as well as informing people about upcoming elections, 
the politicians who are running, and what their stances are. A large percentage of the population fails to go out and 
vote for most elections, meaning that their voices are unheard. People are more likely to go out and vote if they are 
informed about the elections and what the politicians are campaigning on.

The users will have the option to input local townships and areas, and an algorithm will search through a database of
upcoming local elections, and the candidates running. The algorithm will fetch the date of voting, the candidates 
running, and a summary of their policies. The database be PostgreSQL based, and will store a list of the local 
elections, candidates, and their policies.
