  This is the main page for the SOLVER Project (Student OnLine Voting Engagement and Registration

<p>
  The social issue I am attempting to address is getting students registered to vote, as well as informing people about upcoming elections, the politicians who are running, and what their stances are.
  A large percentage of the population fails to go out and vote for most elections, meaning that their voices are unheard.
  People are more likely to go out and vote if they are informed about the elections and what the politicians are campaigning on.
